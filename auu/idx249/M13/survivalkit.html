                <p>I have had the snow leopard Snowy for years; it's about 2 months older than I am, so 31 years old, and my bear Cuddles, which is 2 years younger, so it's 29 years old forever. They are my go-to when I am stressed, anxious, or even depressed. They have been a comfort for me for a long time and something I treasure and look for when I need calming or reassurance.</p>

                 <p>My headphones are important to me when I go out for walks or out into public and have to deal with buses and appointments and other people. Sometimes I get a bit anxious and my anxiety runs high so having my headphones on me helps especially to distract myself by either listening to music or watching videos on Facebook or TikTok.</p>

                <p>My inhalers are helpful for when I need help to breathe. My daily is to be used in the mornings and at night. For my rescue inhaler. I use it when I need and usually that has been if my allergies act up, overworked or when I get high anxiety I need the extra help for my lungs.</p>

            <p>Straws I noticed is something I start chewing on when I get stressed and anxious. It seems to help when it comes to distracting me and helps refocus or calm me down some. I have been doing it since I was young and just never seemed to have broken the habit.</p>

            <p>I use wax melts and incense that help with a calming effect and create a calm atmosphere. Most of the time I love the scents but there are some like dragon's blood, lavendar, suede, and a couple of others that really help to calm me and make me rather relaxed.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Nos is my one energy drink I have everyday, mostly because I get caffeine migraines if I dont have some form of caffeine. It also has the least amount of sugar then some juices and other energy drinks. I am diabetic so it is something I have to watch out for when comes to sugar.</p>

        <div class="content">
             <p>Popcorn is my number one go to snack food when I am anxious or stressed out. It has always been a comfort food and its one thing I dont stress on when comes to sugars or anything. Also makes my anxiety decrease.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Having my phone is important as when I get anxious I like to scroll videos on TikTok and Facebook that I will get lost in for hours at a time without realizing it. It is quite the distraction and helps me forget that I was even anxious in the first place.</p>

         <div class="content">
             <p>My tablet I use the same as the phone but I also like to draw out my custom character illustrations as well as read some ebooks I have so that I can get lost in another world and relax for awhile.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>My books I have been a fan of since I was little. For me books is a way to escape reality. Go into another world and live another life. It's an escape that many people use when stressed or just overwhelmed in general.</p>

            <img src="images/blanket.jpg" width="300px">
        </div>
        <div class="content">
             <p>My blankets are like another form of security when I get highly anxious I will tend to curl up in them and wrap them around me for comfort or support. I also prefer to have soft blankets as it is soothing with the texture of the softness.</p>

      <div class="container" id="fan">

             <img src="images/fan.jpg" width="300px">
         </div>
         <div class="content">
            <p>Having a fan always help as I get more aggreviated if I am really hot so when anxious having a fan on and keeping cool will help. Especially because sometimes when my anxiety goes up I get hot rather quickly which then doesnt help much just adds to my anxiety.</p>

         </div>
         <div class="content">
             <p>Having a hairtie is great as I seem to just wrap them around my wrists or my fingers and kinda fidget with them when I am anxious. It is something that helps even though I am not sure how it started in the first place.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="content">
             <p>My meds are a must just because I am diabetic so I need to make sure to take them everday and same with my allegy pills because I am allergic to all weeds, grass, trees, dust and pet dandruff as well as woods as much as that is all things I love.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="content">
             <p>My vape is important as I have noticed when I get highly stressed or my anxiety increases I tend to smoke more. I quit smoking actual cigarettes a bit over 2 years ago and had switched to vape, but I have noticed I still need the nicotine to help calm me down some.</p>

     <div class="container" id="hoodie">
        <div class="image-container">

        </div>
        <div class="content">
             <p>My hoodie is something that is form fitting mostly minus the arms as they are always bigger then my arms and hands. It is something I like to curl up in and wrap myself in for that extra comfort and support.</p>

    <div class="container" id="deo">
        <div class="image-container">

        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Deodarant is important due to all the sweating when I get anxious and that fact that I can stand to sweat nor the smell.</p>

     <div class="container" id="lotion">
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="images/lotion.jpg" width="300px">
        </div>
        <div class="content">
             <p>Lotion is another thing I like to use from time to time. I have a Lavender and a Vanilla lotion that are both meant for soothing and relaxing. Their scent is quite strong and it actually does help with the calming aspect.</p>

     <div class="container" id="light">
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="images/light.jpg" width="300px">
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Having a light to read is great as well as just having just a tiny lamp to keep it not so dark but a calm relaxing lighting which can help when one becomes anxious because in the dark sometimes it can make it worse.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Having a couple pillows like small soft ones or even small squishy ones is great to cuddle up with and helps give extra comfort.</p>
