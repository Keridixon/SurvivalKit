                <p>I have had anxiety since I was a little kid and was diagnosed early on. It was due to a lot of trauma and things that had happened when I was little. Ever since then I deal with it on a daily basis. Some days are not so bad while others it gets to a point where I can feel my anxiety high and I get extremely stressed out and can become shaky. I have certain things that can help me when I get this way, so that I can calm down and relax some. If I don't then my anxiety can last for hours and I will be shaky for quite some time. Also my anxiety sometimes has me on edge so much that it's all I can think about.</p>
